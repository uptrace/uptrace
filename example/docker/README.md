# Uptrace Open Source demo

## Getting started

This example demonstrates how to quickly start Uptrace using Docker. To run Uptrace permanently, you
can use a DEB/RPM [package](https://uptrace.dev/get/install.html#packages) or a pre-compiled
[binary](https://uptrace.dev/get/install.html#binaries).

**Step 1**. Download the example using Git:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uptrace/uptrace.git
cd uptrace/example/docker
```

**Step 2**. Start the services using Docker:

```shell
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

**Step 3**. Make sure Uptrace is running:

```shell
docker-compose logs uptrace
```

**Step 4**. Open Uptrace UI at [http://localhost:14318](http://localhost:14318)

Uptrace will monitor itself using [uptrace-go](https://github.com/uptrace/uptrace-go) OpenTelemetry
distro. To get some test data, just reload the UI few times. It usually takes about 30 seconds for
the data to appear.

To configure OpenTelemetry for your programming language, see
[documentation](https://uptrace.dev/get/).

## Alerting

Uptrace can monitor metrics using [alerting rules](https://uptrace.dev/get/alerting.html#alerting)
and send notifications via email/Slack/PagerDuty using AlertManager integration.

This example uses MailHog to test email notifications. Open
[http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025) to view available notifications and
[http://localhost:9093](http://localhost:9093) to view alerts.

See [documentation](https://uptrace.dev/get/alerting.html) for more details.

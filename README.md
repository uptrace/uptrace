Uptrace is an OpenTelemetry distributed tracing tool that monitors performance, errors, and logs. It
uses OpenTelelemetry to collect data and ClickHouse database to store it.

Uptrace comes in 2 versions:

- This open source version which only supports distributed tracing.
- [Cloud](https://uptrace.dev/) version that, in addition to tracing, also supports metrics.

## FAQ

**What is the license?**

The Business Source [License](LICENSE) is identical to Apache 2.0 with the only exception being that
you can't use the code to create a cloud service or, in other words, resell it to others as a
product. It is a more permissive license than, for example, AGPL, because it allows private changes
to the code.

You can learn more about BSL [here](https://mariadb.com/bsl-faq-adopting/).

**Are there 2 versions of Uptrace?**

Yes, having 2 separate versions allows us to have minimal number of dependencies (ClickHouse) and
keep the codebase small and fun to work with.

**Is the database schema stable?**

No, we are still making changes to the database schema and hoping to switch to
[ClickHouse dynamic subcolumns](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/23932) when that
feature is available.

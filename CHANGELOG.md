# Changelog

To get started with Uptrace, see https://uptrace.dev/get/get-started.html

## v1.4.0 - Unreleased

#### Breaking changes

- PostgreSQL database is mandatory now. PostgreSQL is only used to store metadata such as users,
  dashboards, metric names, alerts etc. PostgreSQL DB usually only takes few megabytes of disk
  space.

  SQLite support is removed.

- Alerting rules in the config are ignored. Use Uptrace UI to create monitors instead.

- AlertManager client config is ignored. Use Uptrace UI to create AlertManager notification channel.

#### Features

- Port Alerts, Monitors, and Notifications Channels from Uptrace Cloud.
- Add filter facets for metrics.
- Improve UI for switching between table/grid metric views.
- Allow to quickly change group by in the grid.
- Allow to add/edit text gauges.
- Support table visualization in the grid view.
- Support heatmaps in the grid view.
- Allow to customize grid size
- Allow to customize colors for timeseries (just like units).
- Allow to edit dashboards using YAML.
- Add Kafka metrics dashboard.
- Add `site.path` setting to host Uptrace behind a proxy.

#### Fixes

- Fix cumulative to delta metrics conversion.
- Fix exponential histograms handling.

#### TODO

Email notification channel is missing in v1.4.0. We plan to introduce it the follow-up release.
Meanwhile you can still use AlertManager integration.

## v1.3.0 - Jan 20 2023

- Added ability to parse logs as spans using Vector remap language. See
  [documentation](https://uptrace.dev/get/ingest/vector.html#converting-logs-to-spans) and
  [PostgreSQL](https://dev.to/uptrace/monitoring-postgresql-15-logs-with-vector-and-uptrace-4165)
  example for details.

- Added support for Summary metrics type.

- Zipkin ingestion API now requires an Uptrace DSN in one of the following locations:

  - `uptrace-dsn` HTTP header.
  - `Authorization` HTTP header.
  - `dsn` URL query, for example, `/api/v2/spans?dsn=[dsn]`.

- Allow to configure [uptrace-go](https://uptrace.dev/get/opentelemetry-go.html) to collect Uptrace
  telemetry data:

```yaml
##
## uptrace-go client configuration.
## Uptrace sends internal telemetry here. Defaults to listen.grpc.addr.
##
uptrace_go:
  # dsn: http://project1_secret_token@localhost:14317/1
  # tls:
  #   cert_file: config/tls/uptrace.crt
  #   key_file: config/tls/uptrace.key
  #   insecure_skip_verify: true
```

- Added [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) functions to alerting
  [templates](https://uptrace.dev/get/alerting.html#templating).

- Allow to configure logging level via `logs.level` configuration option, for example:

```yaml
logs:
  level: ERROR
```

## v1.2.0 - Nov 8 2022

- Added ability to filter spans using facets.
- Added ability to select multiple systems.
- Added 2 quick filters by `deployment.environment` and `service.name` attributes on the Overview
  page.
- Added support for [creating metrics from spans](https://uptrace.dev/get/span-metrics.html) so they
  can be monitored like usual metrics, for example:

```yaml
# First, create a metric from incoming spans.
metrics_from_spans:
  - name: uptrace.tracing.spans
    description: Spans count (excluding events)
    instrument: counter
    unit: 1
    value: span.count
    attrs:
      - span.system as system
      - service.name as service
      - host.name as host
      - span.status_code as status
    where: not span.is_event

# Then, monitor that metric.
alerting:
  rules:
    - name: Service has high error rate
      metrics:
        - uptrace.tracing.spans as $spans
      query:
        - $spans{status="error"} / $spans > 0.1 group by service.name
      for: 5m
```

- Alerting rules annotations now support templating just like Prometheus, for example:

```yaml
alerting:
  rules:
    - name: Filesystem usage >= 90%
      metrics:
        - system.filesystem.usage as $fs_usage
      query:
        - group by host.name
        - group by device
        - where device !~ "loop"
        - $fs_usage{state="used"} / $fs_usage >= 0.9
      for: 5m
      annotations:
        summary:
          'FS usage is {{ $values.fs_usage }} on {{ $labels.host_name }} and {{ $labels.device }}'
```

- Tweaked spans grouping and added 2 related options:

  - `project.group_by_env` - group spans by `deployment.environment` attribute.
  - `project.group_funcs_by_service` - group `funcs` spans by `service.name` attribute.

- Added project settings page where you can check available settings and project DSN.

- Changed ClickHouse schema to not use column names with dots in them which causes various issues
  with migrations, for example, such columns can't be renamed.

  If you have an existing ClickHouse database, you will have to reset it with:

```shell
uptrace ch reset
```

## v1.1.0 - Oct 1 2022

- Added additional ways to authenticate users via
  [Keycloak](https://uptrace.dev/get/auth-keycloak.html),
  [Google Cloud](https://uptrace.dev/get/auth-keycloak.html), and
  [Cloudflare](https://uptrace.dev/get/auth-cloudflare.html). Contributed by
  [@aramperes](https://github.com/aramperes).

- Added gauges support to Metrics UI. Only used in Redis Enterprise
  [example](example/redis-enterprise) for now.

- Renamed Logs tab to Events and moved all events there.

- Added support for PostgreSQL database instead of SQLite. This requires resetting SQLite database
  with:

```shell
uptrace db reset
```

- [Docker example](example/docker) is updated to work on Windows.
- Added [Redis Enterprise](example/redis-enterprise) example and metrics dashboards.

## v1.0.2 - Sep 8 2022

- Rename `alertmanager` YAML section to `alertmanager_client` so users don't get confused.

## v1.0.0 - Sep 6 2022
